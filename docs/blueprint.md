# **App Name**: Accident Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Data Upload: Allow users to upload accident datasets (e.g., CSV files from Kaggle).
- DBSCAN Clustering: Implement DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify accident hotspots based on location data.
- Hotspot Visualization: Display accident hotspots on an interactive map using different color intensities.
- Parameter Tuning: Enable users to adjust DBSCAN parameters (epsilon and minPts) and observe changes in real-time.
- Risk Assessment Tool: The LLM acts as a risk assessment tool to automatically classify accident hotspots based on contributing factors.
- Detailed Information Display: Show detailed information (e.g., accident count, average severity) for each identified hotspot when selected on the map, including latitude, longitude and other relevant information.
- Region Selection: Provide options to change the region as per the user's preference to show the accident intensity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and reliability in the data.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Vivid orange (#FF5722) to highlight critical hotspots and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Use consistent and clear icons to represent different types of data and actions.
- Design a clear and intuitive layout with well-defined sections for data input, parameter control, map visualization, and results.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction, such as map zooming and data loading.
